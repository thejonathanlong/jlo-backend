1. Create some mechanism for coalescing commits
	a. Don't commit to the database on every insert/update
	b. Group inserts together and commit less frequentyl
	c. Commit before the data is lost

2. Probably need a way to delete some stuff
	a. Comments
	b. Posts
	c. Zones
	d. Media
	e. What if we didn't actually do a delete, but marked things as hidden?
	f. Then I guess we could have a hard "No actually delete this ish" button.
